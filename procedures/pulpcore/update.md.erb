## Update python-pulp_2to3_migration

The `python-pulp_2to3_migration` package is named differently due to a tito bug (the PyPI name uses dashes, not underscores). Due to this, the regular process of updating it cannot be used.

* [ ] Have a regular `foreman-packaging` clone
* [ ] Run `obal update python-pulp_2to3_migration --version X.Y.Z`
* [ ] As `obal` does not update dependencies, verify those are in sync with `setup.py`
